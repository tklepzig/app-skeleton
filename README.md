# App Skeleton

My basic skeleton for react apps.

## Usage

Clone this repo into you desired folder. Adjust `name` and `version` in
`package.json` and run `npm install`. It is encouraged to use the up-to-date
versions of all packages. In order to do this, remove the `package-lock.json`
and run `npm install`. Afterwards, check for possible breaking changes in the
configs/code of the skeleton. If any, contribute these to the skeleton repo as
well.
